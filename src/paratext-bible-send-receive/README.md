## To update this extension from the template

This extension project is forked from [`paranext-extension-template`](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template), which is updated periodically and will sometimes receive updates that help with breaking changes on [`paranext-core`](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-core). We recommend you periodically update your extension by merging the latest template updates into your extension.

To set up this extension to be updated from the template, run the following command once after cloning this repo:

```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template
```

To update this extension from the template, make sure your repo has no working changes. Then run the following commands:

```bash
git fetch template
git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

For more information, read [the instructions on the wiki](https://github.com/paranext/paranext-extension-template/wiki/Merging-Template-Changes-into-Your-Extension).

**Note:** The merge/squash commits created when updating this repo from the template are important; Git uses them to compare the files for future updates. If you edit this repo's Git history, please preserve these commits (do not squash them, for example) to avoid duplicated merge conflicts in the future.
